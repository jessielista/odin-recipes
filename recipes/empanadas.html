    <p>For the cheese jalapeno filling</p>

      <li>

      <li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and baking powder. Cut
        butter into flour using your hands or a pastry cutter until pea-sized.
        Add water and egg and mix until a dough forms. Turn dough out on a
        lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400° and line two large baking sheets with parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>Mix cream cheese and jalapenos in a bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll one
        half out to ¼” thick. Using a 4.5” round cookie cutter, cut out rounds.
        Repeat with remaining dough. Reroll scraps once to cut out more rounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly moisten outer edge of a dough round with water and place about 2
        tablespoons filling in center and top with cheddar and Monterey. Fold
        dough in half over filling. Use a fork to crimp edges together. Repeat
        with remaining filling and dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place empanadas on prepared baking sheets and brush with egg wash. Bake
        until golden and filling is warmed through, about 25 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
